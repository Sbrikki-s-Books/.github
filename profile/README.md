<h2>ðŸ“š WHO WE ARE</h2>
<h4>Sbrikki's Books is an apolitical book club for everyone .<br/>The main aim is the growth of every member from a cultural point of view. We also drink.</h4>

<h2>ðŸš€ WHAT WE DO</h2>
<h4>
The idea comes from the need of some of us to have a space in which to share the passion for culture and the growth of personality while attending an environment where it is difficult to have access to cultural resources.

Thus was born Sbrikki's Books, our Book Club, in which we try, Socratically, to broaden our horizons of thought.

The format is very simple: divided into work groups, we organize the weekly appointment on Thursday evening. We read a good book, drink wine, eat, other things and debate.

The discussion begins after each "chapter" read and concerns what has just been heard.
